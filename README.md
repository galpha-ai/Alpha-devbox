> Anthropic ships [Claude Managed Agents](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents) — hosted agents in cloud sandboxes.
> **Devbox Agent is the self-hosted version:** same persistent-sandbox model, but everything runs on your own clusters.
> Think **Ollama for ChatGPT**, **Supabase for Firebase** — that's what Devbox Agent is for Claude Managed Agents.

## Try it in 60 seconds

```bash
git clone https://github.com/galpha-ai/Alpha-devbox.git && cd Alpha-devbox
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm run dev                   # one command: builds runner image, starts controller + web UI
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5175/** — type a question, get an answer. Your conversation runs inside a persistent sandbox on your machine.

No Slack setup. No Kubernetes. No repo cloning. Just `npm run dev`.

## Why this exists

Every coding agent today makes you choose:

| | Stateless CLI | Hosted SaaS | **Devbox Agent** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Examples | Claude Code, Codex, Aider | Devin, Cursor, Replit Agent | — |
| Persistent workspace | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Self-hosted | ✅ (local only) | ❌ | ✅ (your cloud) |
| Multi-user / team | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Chat-native (Slack/TG) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Open source | partial | ❌ | ✅ |

**Devbox Agent fills the gap**: persistent, multi-user, chat-native agents — on infrastructure you own.

## How it works

```

**Two processes, never shared memory:**
- **Controller** listens to chat platforms, persists state, spawns containers
- **Runner** executes Claude Agent SDK queries inside an isolated sandbox
- **IPC** is filesystem-based — no fragile sockets, no shared memory
- **Bind mounts** make session state durable — the container is ephemeral; the workspace survives

## Key features

### Chat-first, multi-channel
Slack, Telegram, and a bundled web UI out of the box. Mention `@Devbox` in a Slack thread — that thread becomes its own sandbox. The PM, the engineer, and the agent all see the same conversation.

### Persistent sessions
Workspaces and Claude conversation state survive across turns **and** container restarts. Start a backtest at 5pm, come back at 9am — your session is exactly where you left it.

### Agent-as-Code
Each agent is a Git-versioned directory:
```
agents/my-agent/
  CLAUDE.md      # instructions and persona
  seed.yaml      # repos to clone, model, thinking config
  skills/        # optional Claude Code skills
```
Review agents in PRs. Roll back bad prompts with `git revert`. Version your agent fleet like you version your infra.

### Self-hosted, end-to-end
Repos, storage, logs, secrets, model traffic, tool calls — all stay on infrastructure you operate. Docker for local dev; Kubernetes with PVC-backed persistent volumes for production.

## Use cases

**Shared company workspace** — Multiple engineers + the agent share the same repos, tools, and cloud environment. Different Slack threads track different tasks without losing org-level context.

**Long-running coding tasks from chat** — "Fix the flake in `tests/integration/payments_test.go`" → the agent reads, edits, runs tests, opens a PR. Follow-up replies in the same thread route to the same workspace.

**AI research environments** — Describe a strategy in plain language → the agent turns it into code → runs a simulation → iterates. All in one persistent workspace with full session history.

> The bundled `frontend/` is a working example of this pattern — a React + Tailwind research assistant UI that pairs with the `agents/localqa/` demo agent.

## Status

**v0.1 alpha** — core architecture is implemented, tested (252 tests), and ready for early adopters.

| Phase | What | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0** | Sandbox isolation, sessions, multi-channel chat, Docker + K8s | ✅ shipped |
| **1** | REST API aligned with Managed Agents semantics | 🚧 design |
| **2** | Observability (tracing, cost tracking, audit logging) | planned |
| **3** | Multi-agent coordination (agent-to-agent, parent/child) | planned |
| **4** | Self-evaluation and CI/CD integration | planned |

The roadmap targets API compatibility with Claude Managed Agents so you can migrate workloads between hosted and self-hosted without rewriting your orchestration layer. See **[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)** for details.
